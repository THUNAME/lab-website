  description: "Programmable switches have revolutionized network operations by enabling\
    \ the flexible customization of packet processing logic using language like P4.\
    \ However, changing the programs running on the switch requires disturbing traffic\
    \ and suspending other unrelated programs. In this paper, we present P4runpro,\
    \ enabling runtime data plane updates with dynamic resource allocation. The P4runpro\
    \ data plane abstracts hardware resources and defines dynamically reconfigurable\
    \ atomic operations that form packet processing logic. P4runpro provides runtime\
    \ programming interfaces called P4runpro primitives for the operator to write\
    \ high-level programs. We have designed the P4runpro compiler to automatically\
    \ and consistently link the P4runpro programs to the running data plane. We implement\
    \ our prototype on a Tofino switch. We implement 15 example runtime programs using\
    \ P4runpro to demonstrate its generality and expressiveness. Our evaluation results\
    \ show that compared to the state-of-the-art, P4runpro can respond within hundreds\
    \ of milliseconds, achieve an average of 60% to 80% dynamic resource utilization,\
    \ concurrently run \u22480.6K to \u22482.8K programs, and introduce lower overhead.\
    \ Our case studies illustrate the benefit of runtime programming and prove the\
    \ same functionality between P4runpro and conventional P4 programs."

  description: 'As online cloud services expand rapidly, layer-7 load balancing has
    become indispensable for maintaining service availability and performance. The
    emergence of programmable switches with both high performance and a certain degree
    of flexibility has made it possible to apply programmable switches to load balancing.
    Nevertheless, the limited memory capacity and the relatively sluggish speed of
    table entry insertion and deletion of programmable switches have severely constrained
    their performance.

    To this end, we introduce Miresga, a hybrid and high-performance layer-7 load
    balancing system by co-designing hardware and software. The core idea of Miresga
    is to maximize the utilization of hardware and software resources by rationally
    partitioning the layer-7 load balancing task, thereby improving performance. To
    achieve this, Miresga offloads the elephant flows, which account for the majority
    of traffic, to programmable switches that excel at packet processing, and Miresga
    utilizes general-purpose servers with stronger computational capabilities to parse
    application layer protocols and apply load balancing rules. To alleviate memory
    pressure on the programmable switch, Miresga employs a back-end agent to handle
    memory-intensive tasks, working in conjunction with the programmable switch to
    complete the offloaded tasks. This design leverages the performance advantages
    of the programmable switch while avoiding bottlenecks caused by its limited memory
    and table insertion speed. We implement the Miresga prototype with a 3.2 Tbps
    Intel Tofino switch and general-purpose servers. The evaluation results show that
    Miresga achieves \(3.9\times\) throughput and \(0.4\times\) latency compared to
    software load balancing solutions. Compared to the state-of-the-art design employing
    programmable switches, Miresga achieves almost the same throughput and latency
    for delivering large objects and \(5.0\times\) throughput and \(0.2\times\) latency
    when transmitting small objects.

  description: "The vast address space of IPv6 makes it impractical to apply exhaustive\
    \ scanning to survey the entire network. Existing studies that aim to quickly\
    \ discover active IPv6 addresses by optimizing the scanning space face issues\
    \ of poor scalability and high time complexity, which hinder a comprehensive understanding\
    \ of the IPv6 network and impede the timely provision of security snapshots and\
    \ the development of IPv6. Fortunately, the emergence of programmable switches\
    \ provides an opportunity to address the above issues. To this end, we propose\
    \ 6Map, a fast active IPv6 address discovery system based on programmable switches.\
    \ We design a lightweight target generation algorithm running on the control plane\
    \ of the programmable switch and implement fast scanning address generation on\
    \ the switch ASIC. The experimental results show that IPv6 active address discovery\
    \ efficiency is up to 40.1\xD7 compared to the state-of-the-art method at the\
    \ 100M probe budget."

  description: "With the large-scale deployment and application of IPv6, IPv6 network\
    \ measurements will become increasingly important. However, a special type of\
    \ IPv6 prefix called Fully Responsive Prefix (FRP) is having a significant impact\
    \ on IPv6 measurement campaigns, which is defined as all addresses under a prefix\
    \ responding to scans. Obviously, there cannot be a real responder behind each\
    \ of these addresses. To reveal the current status and impact of Internet-wide\
    \ IPv6 FRPs, we propose for the first time an active probing method for Internet-wide\
    \ IPv6 FRPs, Luori, which transforms the active probing process under IPv6 huge\
    \ prefix space (potential range of prefix presence) into a dynamic search process\
    \ in a tree based on reinforcement learning, achieving efficient probing of arbitrary\
    \ routing prefixes. The evaluation results show that Luori found 31.7K largest\
    \ FRPs in a single Internet-wide probing with 11M budget, covering 1.5\xD71030\
    \ address space, which is 106\xD7 that of existing methods. More importantly,\
    \ after six months of Internet-wide probing, we have found 516K largest FRPs,\
    \ which covers 1.3 \xD7 1033 address space and 795 ASes, making it the largest\
    \ publicly known FRP list. Based on this list, we screen out 20% of the addresses\
    \ covered by FRPs from a well-known IPv6 active address dataset. Furthermore,\
    \ we further analyze and find that the distribution of these FRPs is extensive\
    \ and their implementation methods are diverse, which can provide beneficial references\
    \ for the practical application of FRPs. We also make this list publicly available\
    \ and maintain it long-term for use and study by relevant researchers."

  description: As native IPv6 adoption increases, the use of 6to4 tunnels has declined,
    yet they remain a significant security concern in today's Internet. This study
    investigates the real-world deployment of 6to4 tunnels, revealing their current
    scale, characteristics, and security implications. We identify open 6to4 relays
    in 216 countries and 13,114 autonomous systems, noting stable short-term counts
    but a long-term decline. We analyze the security of these nodes and find over
    578k nodes vulnerable to address spoofing and packet injection. Additionally,
    we present several under-emphasized scenarios where open 6to4 nodes are abused,
    including leveraging services on 6to4 nodes as traffic amplifiers, circumventing
    restrictions using multiple 6to4 addresses, and connecting 6to4 nodes to render
    attacks untraceable.
